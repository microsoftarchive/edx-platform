       Studio offers three types of problems that allow learners to select one or more options from a list that you provide.
       - Checkbox problems allow learners to select multiple options. Learners can see all the options along with the problem text.
       - Dropdown problems allow learners to select only one option. Learners only see all the options after they click the dropdown list.
       - Multiple choice problems allow learners to select only one option. Learners can see all the options along with the problem text.

       To create a checkbox problem in the simple editor:
       1. Enter the text of the main question between angle brackets.
       2. Enter the text of each answer option on a separate line.
       3. Add brackets that contain a space before each answer option: [ ]
       4. For each correct answer, add an x between the parentheses: [x]
       Note that a checkbox problem can have more than one correct answer.
       5. To add an explanation, enter the text of the explanation, and then highlight the explanation and click the light bulb icon.

       You can use the following example problem as a model.
